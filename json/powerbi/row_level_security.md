# Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI

In the context of Power BI, RLS stands for **Row-Level Security**. It's a powerful feature that allows you to control which rows of data a user can see in a report or dashboard. This is crucial for data governance and security, ensuring that users only have access to the data that is relevant to their role or department.

For example, you could have a single sales report that shows data for all regions. By implementing RLS, a regional sales manager in Europe would only see sales data for Europe, while a different manager in Asia would only see data for Asia, even though they are both viewing the same report.

## How it Works

RLS in Power BI is a two-part process:

1. **Creating Roles in Power BI Desktop:**
   - You define roles (e.g., "Europe Manager", "Asia Manager") and use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create filters that define the data each role can access.
   - For instance, you might create a rule that says `[Country] = "Europe"`.
   - You can't define roles for live connections to Analysis Services, as RLS is handled in the Analysis Services model itself.

2. **Assigning Users in the Power BI Service:**
   - After publishing the report to the Power BI Service, you assign users or security groups (from Microsoft Entra ID) to the roles you created.
   - When a user with a specific role opens the report, the RLS filter is automatically applied, and they only see the data allowed by their role.

## Types of RLS

There are two main types of RLS you can implement:

- **Static RLS:** This is the simplest method. You manually create roles and define the filters for each one in Power BI Desktop. This works well for a small number of roles or when the security rules don't change frequently.
- **Dynamic RLS:** This is a more scalable approach. Instead of hardcoding the filters for each role, you use DAX functions like `USERNAME()` or `UserPrincipalName()` in your data model. This allows Power BI to automatically filter the data based on the logged-in user's credentials, without you having to manually assign every user to a role. This is ideal for large organizations with many users and constantly changing security requirements.

## Key Considerations and Best Practices

- **RLS is for Viewers:** RLS filters only apply to users with **Viewer** permissions in a Power BI workspace. It does not restrict data access for Admins, Members, or Contributors.
- **Performance:** RLS adds a filter to your queries, which can have an impact on performance. It's a best practice to design your data model efficiently to minimize this impact.
- **Testing:** Power BI Desktop provides a "View as" feature that allows you to test your RLS roles to ensure they are working as intended before publishing the report.
- **Centralized Management:** For dynamic RLS, it's often a good practice to manage user-to-role mappings in a separate table in your data source (like a SQL database or an Excel file on SharePoint). This makes it easier to update user permissions without having to modify and republish your Power BI report.
- **Not a Replacement for Other Security:** RLS is an important part of data security, but it's not a complete solution. It's essential to use other security measures like workspace roles, data gateways, and object-level security (OLS) to protect your data effectively.

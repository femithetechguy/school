T-SQL, or **Transact-SQL**, is Microsoft's proprietary extension of the standard SQL (Structured Query Language). While standard SQL is a declarative language used for managing data in a relational database, T-SQL adds procedural programming capabilities, making it a more powerful and flexible tool for developers and database administrators.

### Key Features and Differences from Standard SQL

The main distinction between T-SQL and standard SQL lies in T-SQL's additional features that enable more complex logic and control over database operations.

* **Procedural Programming:** T-SQL allows for the use of variables, loops (`WHILE`), and conditional statements (`IF...ELSE`). This allows developers to write complex logic directly within the database.
* **Error Handling:** It includes robust error handling with `TRY...CATCH` blocks, which is crucial for building reliable and resilient database applications.
* **Enhanced Statements:** T-SQL has proprietary enhancements to standard SQL statements. For example, to retrieve the first 10 rows from a table, you'd use `SELECT TOP 10` in T-SQL instead of the standard SQL `LIMIT` clause.
* **Stored Procedures and Functions:** T-SQL is the language used to create and manage stored procedures and user-defined functions in Microsoft SQL Server. These are pre-compiled code blocks that improve performance and enforce business logic at the database level.
* **Transaction Control:** It provides advanced transaction control features, allowing for the execution of multiple statements as a single, atomic unit of work with commands like `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.

### How T-SQL is Used

T-SQL is the core language for interacting with Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and other Microsoft data products. All applications and tools that communicate with a SQL Server instance do so by sending T-SQL commands. It is used for a wide range of tasks, including:

* **Data Manipulation:** Inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data.
* **Data Definition:** Creating, altering, and dropping database objects like tables, views, and indexes.
* **Database Administration:** Performing maintenance tasks, managing security, and configuring server settings.
* **Application Development:** Building business logic into the database using stored procedures, triggers, and functions.

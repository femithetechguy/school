# Power BI Semantic Models

A semantic model in Power BI is a central repository for data that provides a single, consistent source of truth for reports. It's the underlying data structure that sits between your raw data sources and the visualizations in a report. Think of it as a logical description of your data, transforming complex, unprocessed data into meaningful, business-friendly information.

## Key Components of a Semantic Model

A Power BI semantic model includes several core components that work together to create a cohesive and reusable data source:

- **Tables and Columns:** This is the foundation of the model, where raw data is organized. Tables are collections of related data, and columns represent the attributes within those tables.
- **Relationships:** These define how tables are connected to each other. By establishing relationships, you can perform comprehensive analysis across different tables.
- **Measures and Calculated Columns:** Using Data Analysis Expressions (**DAX**), you can create measures (calculations that aggregate data) and calculated columns (new columns based on existing data). These ensure consistent calculations and metrics across all reports.
- **Roles and Security:** The model can include security permissions, such as **row-level security (RLS)**, to control what data different users can see, ensuring sensitive information is protected.

## Benefits and Purpose

The primary purpose of a semantic model is to create a standardized, reusable, and secure data layer for an organization. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Consistency:** It ensures all reports built from the model use the same data and calculations, eliminating discrepancies and providing "one version of the truth."
- **Reusability:** A single semantic model can be used as a source for many different reports and dashboards, reducing the need to build separate data models for each one.
- **Centralized Governance:** The model simplifies data governance and maintenance. Instead of managing multiple datasets, you only need to manage and refresh a single, centralized model.
- **Simplified Reporting:** It simplifies the report-building process for users by hiding the technical complexities of the underlying data sources.

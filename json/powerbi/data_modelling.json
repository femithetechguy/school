  "description": "Data modeling in data analytics is the process of structuring and organizing data—usually in the form of tables, relationships, and rules—to ensure it’s accurate, scalable, and optimized for analytics and reporting. It serves as the blueprint for how data is stored, related, and queried within a data warehouse, a Power BI model, or any other analytics platform.",

"Content Packs" were a feature in the Power BI service for sharing a curated collection of dashboards, reports, and datasets with a group of people in an organization. They were essentially a way to package and distribute content in a standardized and controlled manner.

However, it's important to know that **content packs are a legacy feature and have been replaced by Power BI Apps.**

### Content Packs vs. Power BI Apps

The key reason for this change was to address some of the limitations of content packs and provide a more robust and flexible sharing model. Here's a quick comparison of the two:

* **Sharing Model:**
    * **Content Packs:** When a user acquired a content pack, they received a copy of the content (reports, dashboards, and dataset) in their own "My Workspace." This allowed them to make personal changes, which could lead to multiple, unmanaged versions of the same content.
    * **Power BI Apps:** Apps provide a **read-only view** of the content from a centralized workspace. Users can see and interact with the reports and dashboards, but they cannot modify the original content. This ensures a single source of truth for the data and analysis.

* **Governance and Control:**
    * **Content Packs:** Managing updates was a pain. If the original content pack was updated, users had to manually update their local copies, or the changes would not be reflected.
    * **Power BI Apps:** The app creator controls the content in a single workspace. When they make a change and "update the app," all users automatically see the latest version. This makes governance and version control much simpler.

* **User Experience:**
    * **Content Packs:** Users had to go to the "Get Data" section to find and install content packs.
    * **Power BI Apps:** Apps are a much cleaner and more modern experience. They appear in a dedicated "Apps" section in the Power BI service, and a single link can be used to share the entire app with a user or group. App creators can also build a custom navigation menu to guide users through the content.

### How Apps Work Now

Power BI Apps are the current and recommended method for sharing content with a broad audience. Hereâ€™s the general workflow:

1.  **Create a Workspace:** All the content for the app (reports, dashboards, datasets) is developed and stored in a shared workspace.
2.  **Publish an App:** From the workspace, you can "Publish App." This action packages the selected content into a user-friendly application.
3.  **Configure the App:** You can customize the app's name, description, logo, and navigation. You can also specify which dashboards and reports to include.
4.  **Share the App:** You can share the app with specific individuals, Microsoft 365 groups, or your entire organization.
5.  **User Experience:** End-users can access the app from the "Apps" section of their Power BI service. They get a clean, read-only view of the content, ensuring they're always looking at the most current and authoritative data.

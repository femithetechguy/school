🔧 Technical Tips for Embedding

🎙️ Embed Multiple Podcast Episodes

Use Spotify or Anchor:

<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/YOUR_EPISODE_ID" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

📺 Embed Multiple YouTube Videos

You can:
	•	Embed full playlists:

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


	•	Or embed single videos repeatedly with titles, e.g.:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

🏗️ Recommended Build Method

Since you’ll have growing content, you need something scalable and easy to manage:

Platform	Why Use It
Notion + Super.so	Easy for adding content & links, embeds work great
Framer	Beautiful layouts, drag-and-drop, supports embeds
GitHub Pages	If you want full control with HTML/CSS
Typedream	Like Webflow but easier; great for educators
